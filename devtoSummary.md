# Dev.to Article Summary #

I spent *most* of my time reading articles that focused more on your self development over the course of your journey learning code and eventually working your way into a career. A lot of them talked about mindset or things that people had learned within their first few weeks/months/years in development jobs.


## Headspace & Why it Matters ##

![A happy brain - just like yours](https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/219127/screenshots/1867160/media/f32696cafa49edfa077e14f2a2fc1f5d.jpg?compress=1&resize=800x600&vertical=top)

 The **NUMBER ONE** thing I've learned that you should be as a developer is *OPEN*. You need to be open minded, open to your community, and open to criticism. If you show up for people, they will show up for you. Obviously, a valuable life lesson but can just as deeply be applied to development. Your work will be held under a microscope but none of the criticism is ever meant as an attack. Your ego will ruin you in this industry. 

Maintaining a good headspace can be done through journaling during work through things like *"Notion"*, a good tool for project management and guiding yourself through tickets or even just keeping track or where you're at with certain problems. Keeping a level head will also make it easier to do things like asking the "stupid" questions or being proactive when things inevitably go wrong ~~like when you break your code and now you have to read through it to see where it broke.~~



## Clean Code Mentality ##

Another huge thing I learned was how to and why you should try to develop good coding habits early on. *Clean Code* will make your life exponentially easier when you start working with other developers. 

 Some tips included:
- Utilize variable and function names. Having less **repeating** code will make it easier for you and everyone else to read.

 - **DOCUMENTATION**. Use comments to explain what parts of your code do and also to notate things that may need to be added/modified.

 - Be modular so that changes and new features can easily be added.
- Well tested means less bugs.


## Why are you here? ##

Getting into the tech world is not an easy feat for anyone. The greatest thing to do for yourself is to find your motivation and stick to it. Whether it be for more financial stability, self development, or some greater good you wish to inflict on the world - your motivation will keep you in this longer than sheer will power alone. As people and as developers, we are students forever. Give yourself a reason to continue learning.
